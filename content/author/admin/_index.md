I am a second year Master's student studying Computer Science at the University of California, Davis. My main areas of research include Distributed Systems and Blockchains. I am also an Amazon Alexa Prize 2018 winner. 

I have worked for over two years at FIS Global as a Product Development Engineer with a special focus on Continuous Integration and DevOps. I also interned at Nokia Nuage Networks in the Summer of 2018. 

When I am not working, I am either watching soccer or playing soccer or in the gym- running.
